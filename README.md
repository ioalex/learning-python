# Learning Python

A monorepo of old novice Python projects üêç.

---

This repository holds a set of small beginner Python projects that I completed in early 2020.

I started these projects during the COVID-19 lockdown in hopes to escape boredom and learn something new. Like a lot of newcomers to the world of programming, I stumbled into the Python language and was quickly astounded at what was possible with writing code. That being said, I have since moved away from Python to learn more about Unix & web development, however these Python projects will always have a place in my heart and are a reminder of my humble beginnings.
